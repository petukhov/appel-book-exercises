# Modern Compiler Implementation in ML - Solutions in OCaml

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book *Modern Compiler Implementation in ML* by Andrew W. Appel, implemented in OCaml.

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, you need to have the following tools installed:

- **OCaml**: The programming language chosen for implementing the exercises.
- **Opam**: The OCaml package manager for managing dependencies.
- **Dune**: A build system for OCaml projects.

You can find detailed installation instructions in the [OCaml installation guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml).

## Running the Exercises

To execute the solution for exercise 2 from chapter 1, run the following command:

```bash
opam exec -- dune exec ch1_ex2 -w
```

For other exercises, you can use a similar command by replacing ch1_ex2 with the corresponding executable name for each specific exercise.
